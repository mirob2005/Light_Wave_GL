  abstract = {This paper presents a fast approximation method to obtain the point
	hit by a reflection or refraction ray. The calculation is based on
	the distance values stored in environment map texels. This approximation
	is used to localize environment mapped reflections and refractions,
	that is, to make them depend on where they occur. On the other hand,
	placing the eye into the light source, the method is also good to
	generate real-time caustics. Computing a map for each refractor surface,
	we can even evaluate multiple refractions without tracing rays. The
	method is fast and accurate if the scene consists of larger planar
	faces, when the results are similar to that of ray-tracing. On the
	other hand, the method suits very well to the GPU architecture, and
	can render ray-tracing and global illumination effects with few hundred
	frames per second. The primary application area of the proposed method
	is the introduction of these effects in games. 1.},

	result because computations are indepedent of viewer position. This

	reflectivities can be changed, with minimal extra computation. The

	The beams are adaptively generated from a grid projected from the

	This allows us to reconstruct sharp volume caustic patterns while
	reducing sampling resolution and fill-rate at defocused regions.

	techniques to render surfaces with two-sided refractions as well

	captures light transport over larger distances well, but it requires
	clamping of the point lights' contribution to avoid bright splotches

	the algorithm removes some energy and thus introduces bias, that

	improves the quality and correctness of the rendered images by removing

	cluster center we apply final gather to evaluate its incident irradiance
	using GPU-based photon mapping. We approximate the entire photon
	tree as a compact illumination cut, thus reducing the final gather
	cost for each ray. The sampled irradiance values are then interpolated
	at all shading points to produce rendering. Our method exploits the
	spatial coherence of illumination to reduce sampling cost. We sample
	sparsely and the distribution of sample points conforms with the
	underlying illumination changes. Therefore our method is both fast
	and preserves high rendering quality. Although the same property
	has been exploited by previous caching and adaptive sampling methods,
	these methods typically require sequential computation of sample
	points, making them ill-suited for the GPU. In contrast, we select
	sample points adaptively in a single pass, enabling parallel computation.
	As a result, our algorithm runs entirely on the GPU, achieving interactive
	rates for scenes with complex illumination effects.},

  abstract = {An efficient ray tracing method is presented for calculating interreflections
	between surfaces with both diffuse and specular components. A Monte
	Carlo technique computes the indirect contributions to illuminance
	at locations chosen by the rendering process. The indirect illuminance
	values are averaged over surfaces and used in place of a constant
	"ambient" term. Illuminance calculations are made only for those
	areas participating in the selected view, and the results are stored
	so that subsequent views can reuse common values. The density of
	the calculation is adjusted to maintain a constant accuracy, permitting
	less populated portions of the scene to be computed quickly. Successive
	reflections use proportionally fewer samples, which speeds the process
	and provides a natural limit to recursion. The technique can also
	model diffuse transmission and illumination from large area sources,
	such as the sky.},

  abstract = {The mapping of images onto surfaces may substantially increase the
	realism and information content of computer-generated imagery. The
	projection of a flat source image onto a curved surface may involve
	sampling difficulties, however, which are compounded as the view
	of the surface changes. As the projected scale of the surface increases,
	interpolation between the original samples of the source image is
	necessary; as the scale is reduced, approximation of multiple samples
	in the source is required. Thus a constantly changing sampling window
	of view-dependent shape must traverse the source image. To reduce
	the computation implied by these requirements, a set of prefiltered
	source images may be created. This approach can be applied to particular
	advantage in animation, where a large number of frames using the
	same source image must be generated. This paper advances a “pyramidal
	parametric” prefiltering and sampling geometry which minimizes aliasing
	effects and assures continuity within and between target images.
	Although the mapping of texture onto surfaces is an excellent example
	of the process and provided the original motivation for its development,
	pyramidal parametric data structures admit of wider application.
	The aliasing of not only surface texture, but also highlights and
	even the surface representations themselves, may be minimized by
	pyramidal parametric means.},

  abstract = {Shadowing has historically been used to increase the intelligibility
	of scenes in electron microscopy and aerial survey. Various methods
	have been published for the determination of shadows in computer
	synthesized scenes. The display of shadows may make the shape and
	relative position of objects in such scenes more comprehensible;
	it is a technique lending vividness and realism to computer animation.
	To date, algorithms for the determination of shadows have been restricted
	to scenes constructed of planar polygons. A simple algorithm is described
	which utilizes Z-buffer visible surface computation to display shadows
	cast by objects modelled of smooth surface patches. The method can
	be applied to all environments, in fact, for which visible surfaces
	can be computed. The cost of determining the shadows associated with
	each light source is roughly twice the cost of rendering the scene
	without shadows, plus a fixed transformation overhead which depends
	on the image resolution. No extra entities are added to the scene
	description in the shadowing process. This comprehensive algorithm,
	which permits curved shadows to be cast on curved surfaces, is contrasted
	with a less costly method for casting the shadows of the environment
	on a single ground plane. In order to attain good results, the discrete
	nature of the visible-surface computations must be treated with care.
	The effects of dither, interpolation, and geometric quantization
	at different stages of the shadowing algorithm are examined. The
	special problems posed by self-shadowing surfaces are described.},
