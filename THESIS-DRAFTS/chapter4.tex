\section{Thesis Format Specs}

Here are some more format requirements.

\subsection{Font} 
The final thesis must be in 12-point size in a standard font such as Times New Roman or
Arial or True Type font.

\subsection{Margins}
Margins must be set as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\item Left margin must be 1.5 inches.  
\item Top, right and bottom margins must be 1 inch.
\item Headers and footers must be set at 1 inch for page numbers. 
\item All major titles must start 2 inches from the top of page
 (e.g., abstract, chapter titles, table of contents, and bibliography).   
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Tables and Figures}
In general, table names go on top of the table, while figure captions go beneath.
  All captions should be on the same page as the figure, if possible.
 You may place a table or figure alone on a page on the first available page after its mention,
 as long as you fill the page before it with text, as in a textbook. 

\begin{table}
\caption{My Thesis Commitee}
\vspace{.1in}
\label{table-1}
\begin{tabular}{|l|l|l|}\hline
Dr. Sam Jones & Chair & Department of Computer Science \\ \hline
Dr. Turtle Donatello & Member & Department of Electrical Engineering \\ \hline
Dr. Barney Dinosaur  & Member & Department of Civil Engineering \\ \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

Charts or graphs may be reduced to fit within the margin requirements just make sure the reduction
 is legible enough to read and microfilm well. Text or numbers within a table or figure should thus
 be no smaller than 10-pt. text that is smaller in the original will be unreadable when reduced in
 microfilm and will not be accepted. 

\begin{figure}[h]

\label{fig-1}
\end{figure}

All graphs, charts, tables, figures, computer printouts and appendices must fit within the standard
 margins. The content of illustrations, tables and figures should conform to the instructions
 in Turabian or your authorized style manual.  
Do not wrap text around a figure. Insert an extra single space at least on before the table or
 figure and after its caption to separate it visually from the text.

\subsection{Page Numbers}
The pages that precede the chapters of your thesis, such as the Abstract, Table of Contents,
 and Acknowledgment, are called frontis pages, or front matter. All frontis pages are numbered
 in lower-case Roman numerals centered one inch from the bottom of the page. The title/approval
 page should not be numbered, though it will be counted as page i. The first numbered page contains
 the abstract. Subsequent frontis pages are numbered consecutively from there.
 Our template sets the page numbers automatically.

The text and all subsequent pages, including the bibliography and appendices, are paginated
 consecutively in Arabic numerals beginning with 1 on the first page. The first page of each
 chapter or each main section, like the bibliography, should be at the bottom center at one inch.
 Subsequent page numbers are positioned in the upper-right corner.
