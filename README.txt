Thesis Test Implementation using OpenGL and GLSL
Start Date: 5/31/12


Assignment was completed using Visual Studio 2008 Pro on Windows 7 64-bit.
Included is all .cpp, .h, and .txt to independently run using any compiler.

All files must be in the same directory to be found.

* The project extends my Light_Wave implementation using OpenGL and GLSL rather than a raytracer.

* This test implementation will attempt to model the global illumination in the scene more like a wave rather than a point light source


* RayTracer_GLSL_Compare.jpg shows current OpenGL output in comparison to the rayTracer output


TODO:
1) Add Shadows to the scene using shadow maps
2) Add an fps tracker
3) Add Light_Wave logic
